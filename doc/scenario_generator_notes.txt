Goals:

Only using top layer?

Should plant factor be zero for non-ag crops?

In the Fortran code, writing of soil_water_m_all and velocity_all is confined to top soil increment (increments_1).
Why bother calculating other increments?  Also bulk density

Velocity only written if there's action in the top layer?

What's with velocity(0, :) in the fortran code?

Erosion day and erosion month not populated.  As a result "index_day" is being calculated for month 'zero', which
means the first indices of date_holder are -31
The whole date_holder thing doesn't make much sense to me

cn_ag and cn_fallow are entered in opposite orders

If bad input data is detected and run is skipped, is carry-over output still written?
