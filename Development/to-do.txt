* Clarify the origin of lookup tables by either (1) pointing directly to NHD/SSURGO, or (2) creating extraction scripts

* Further refine field specifcation, make sure applies throughout workflow

* Streamline for speed and clarity

* Explore aggregation procedure more. Combine?

* Make run as regions instead of states.  Mosaic SSURGO rasters.

* De-ESRIfy

* CondensedNHD as source of HUC-8 data

* Improve variable names

* Get all scripts working and check validity

* Depth weighting after component selection?

* Rebuild 'extract_ssurgo' script, build in functionality to preserve field types

* Maybe even build a 'streamline ssurgo' companion to streamline NHD

* Rename keys in CondensedNHD from table/key to data/columns, for ** reading into pd dataframe
